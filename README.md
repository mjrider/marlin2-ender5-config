# marlin2-ender5-config
My configuration for my Ender 5

My configuration
 - based on the settings of Teaching tech for inverting the bed so the view of cura matches the printer
 - printer has a SKR Dip V1.1 With 4 TMC2209


**WARNING**
The configuration assumes that the X endstop has been moved about 1cm to the
outside so create a bit more space to move the gantry.  that also means that
the nozzle could move outside the printbed. This is for the bltouch to reach
enough of the printbed to place the grid on the middel of the bed

This configuration also assumes that the Z-axis is replaced by a screw with 
a lead of 2mm ( the 400 -> 1600 steps change for the Z axis)
